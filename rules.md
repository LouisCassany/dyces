## Example Dice Patterns

Abilities are written on each Character Sheet using **numbers and sets**, not custom symbols. Examples:

- **Quick Strike**: 2 of a kind → Deal 3 dmg.  
- **Heavy Blow**: 3 of a kind → Deal 6 dmg.  
- **Sweeping Attack**: Small straight (1-2-3-4 or 2-3-4-5) → Deal 5 dmg to target, all others lose 1 HP.  
- **Focused Strike**: 4 of a kind → Deal 8 dmg.  
- **Ultimate Attack**: 5 of a kind or Large straight (2-3-4-5-6) → Deal 10 dmg + inflict Stun.

## Status Effects

- **Burn**: At start of turn, lose 1 HP. Remove after 2 turns.  
- **Poison**: Lose 1 HP at start of turn until cleansed.  
- **Shield**: Prevent the next 2 dmg received.  
- **Stun**: Skip next Offensive Roll Phase.

## Resource System

- **Combat Points (CP)** are earned automatically (1 each turn).  
- Spend CP to:  
  - Activate upgrades (e.g. improve “Quick Strike” from 3 dmg → 4 dmg).  
  - Reroll one die outside the normal roll limit (1 CP).  
  - Cleanse a negative status (2 CP).

- Last player standing (or team standing) wins.
